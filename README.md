# Machine Learning Lab

My experiments with various datasets as I learn about artificial intelligence and machine learning. My goal is to achieve optimal results in tasks such as prediction, classification,...

## Structure

Each folder typically includes:

1. Dataset
2. Jupyter notebook(s)
3. Python scripts
4. `index.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that explores the data, defines the task, and provides a comparison table of all tested models and techniques.

## Updates

I'm continuously updating this repository as I learn about new algorithms, techniques, or develop my own ideas.
